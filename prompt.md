Can u generate a multistep plan.md for Claude to create the "People Bets" project. Essentially this platform will be for users to place bets on things that their fellow users have created using the platform's currency.

-Tech stack should be using Vite + React and Supabase
-There should be a login/sign up functionality. Users must be signed in in order to use this platform.
-Users should be allowed to create "people bets", and for now they can only choose one bet type, "Higher or Lower". There should be more options grayed out and saying something like "coming soon". When the user selects the "Higher or Lower" bet type to create, they need to at least fill in the title, description, Higher or Lower number, and betting window. After the betting window ends, only the creator of the bet should be allowed to decide which side won (higher or lower)
-Aside from the "global" group which all users can see the bets for, users can create private groups, so that the bets can only be seen by people inside the private group. There should be a mechanism to allow others users to join these private groups. Inside a private group, only the group leader should be allowed to create people bets.
-All users can claim free currency daily if they login into the website and click "claim" somewhere

IMPORTANT: Do NOT write any code, and there is no need to maintain backward compatibility

Please read phase 7 for /Users/mensun/Documents/projects/people-bets/plan.md
Now think hard and write elegant code that completes this and nothing else
Do not add backwards compatibility
